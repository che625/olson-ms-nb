### IPython Notebook for downloading and analyzing data from preprint: "Indication of family-specific DNA methylation patterns in developing oysters"
[http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/012831](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/012831)

---

The repository includes a IPython notebook (.ipynb file) that can be downloaded and interactively executed. The code in the IPython notebook will download raw data and process data such that figures in the manuscript are reproduced (in theory). 

---
To execute the IPython Notebook in its entirety you will need:   

* IPython     
* BSMAP   
* bedtools   
* R   
* rpy2 (interface to R from Python)   

---
Note the current version of the IPython Notebook can be viewed (not interactive) with in web browser at: 
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/che625/olson-ms-nb/blob/master/BiGo_dev.ipynb>

----
